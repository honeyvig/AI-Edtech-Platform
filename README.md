Step-by-Step Python Code Development

Below is a skeleton of the architecture and code to get started on building this educational platform:
1. Backend Service (FastAPI for AI Tutor Integration)

We'll start by setting up the backend where the AI models and APIs will interact with the front end.

import openai
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

# FastAPI initialization
app = FastAPI()

# OpenAI API key for GPT-based models
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"

class StudentQuery(BaseModel):
    subject: str
    grade: str
    question: str

class TeacherQuery(BaseModel):
    subject: str
    grade: str
    task: str  # For lesson planning, quiz generation, etc.

@app.post("/ask_student_tutor/")
async def ask_student_tutor(query: StudentQuery):
    """Handle student queries to AI tutor"""
    prompt = f"Answer the following question based on {query.subject} curriculum for {query.grade}: {query.question}"
    try:
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            model="gpt-4",  # Use the relevant model
            prompt=prompt,
            max_tokens=150
        )
        return {"response": response.choices[0].text.strip()}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@app.post("/ask_teacher_tutor/")
async def ask_teacher_tutor(query: TeacherQuery):
    """Help teachers generate lesson plans or quizzes"""
    prompt = f"Create a lesson plan for {query.subject} for {query.grade}. Task: {query.task}"
    try:
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            prompt=prompt,
            max_tokens=300
        )
        return {"response": response.choices[0].text.strip()}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@app.post("/ask_career_advice/")
async def ask_career_advice(student_interests: str, student_skills: str):
    """AI-driven career and university recommendation for students"""
    prompt = f"Provide career advice based on the student's interests: {student_interests}, and skills: {student_skills}."
    try:
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            prompt=prompt,
            max_tokens=300
        )
        return {"response": response.choices[0].text.strip()}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

Explanation:

    Student and Teacher AI Tutors:
        The ask_student_tutor function takes a student’s subject, grade, and question, and returns a GPT-based response.
        The ask_teacher_tutor function helps teachers generate lesson plans or quizzes based on a subject and grade.
    AI Career Counselor:
        The ask_career_advice function helps provide career or university recommendations based on student interests and skills.
    OpenAI GPT Integration:
        OpenAI's GPT-4 API is used here to generate responses based on natural language queries. You can extend this to use other models or fine-tune them.

2. Frontend Interface (React + WebSocket for real-time interaction)

The frontend could use React to build a responsive user interface for students, teachers, and administrators.

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function App() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const [response, setResponse] = useState('');
  const [role, setRole] = useState('student');  // 'student', 'teacher', 'counselor'

  const handleQuerySubmit = async () => {
    try {
      const result = await axios.post(`http://localhost:8000/ask_${role}_tutor/`, { question: query });
      setResponse(result.data.response);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error:", error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>AI Educational Platform</h1>
      <select value={role} onChange={(e) => setRole(e.target.value)}>
        <option value="student">Student</option>
        <option value="teacher">Teacher</option>
        <option value="counselor">Counselor</option>
      </select>
      <textarea
        value={query}
        onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Ask your question..."
      />
      <button onClick={handleQuerySubmit}>Submit</button>
      <div>
        <h3>Response:</h3>
        <p>{response}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

Explanation:

    The React app allows users to select their role (student, teacher, or counselor).
    Users can input their queries and receive answers from the backend API.
    The axios library sends requests to the FastAPI backend to interact with the AI models.

3. Career and College Counseling (Integration with External APIs)

To provide accurate recommendations for career and college choices, you can integrate third-party APIs like:

    CollegeScorecard API: Provides data on colleges and universities in the U.S.
    Scholarship APIs: To suggest scholarships based on a student's profile.

You can create similar endpoints to fetch this data and combine it with the AI-driven recommendations.
Next Steps:

    Integrating Machine Learning Models:
        Train and fine-tune AI models for subjects, tests, and counseling.
        Continuously improve based on feedback from students and teachers.

    Frontend Development:
        Create dashboards for teachers and admins to manage content, track student progress, etc.

    Real-time Features:
        Implement real-time tutoring via WebSocket for interactive lessons.

    Scalability:
        Ensure the backend can scale using cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, etc.

    Security & Privacy:
        Ensure GDPR and COPPA compliance for data privacy and security.

Conclusion:

The project will require a combination of AI/ML development, backend & frontend integration, and cloud-based scaling to offer a seamless experience for students, teachers, and counselors. By leveraging powerful AI models, APIs, and secure backend systems, you can create an impactful educational platform tailored to the needs of modern learners and educators.
